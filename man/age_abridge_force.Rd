\title{force a (count) vector to abridged ages}
\usage{
age_abridge_force(Value, AgeInt, Age)
}
\arguments{
\item{Value}{numeric. Vector of (presumably) counts in grouped ages.}

\item{AgeInt}{integer or numeric. Vector of age intervals.}

\item{Age}{numeric. Vector of ages corresponding to the lower integer bound of the age range.}
}
\description{
This is a robustness utility, in place to avoid annoying hang-ups in \code{LTAbr()}. If data are given in non-standard ages, they are forced to standard abrdiged ages on the fly. Really this should happen prior to calling \code{LTAbr()}
}
\details{
This should be able to group up and group down as needed. \code{graduate_mono()} is used below the hood. \code{pclm()} or \code{splitUniform()} out to be flexible enough to do the same.
