# notes from patrick:
# should be a generic function with loess as first option under the hood,
# choice between user-specified smoothing paramater and gcv crit
# 2nd option would be 2nd degree polynomial (no auto detect, but in general
# intended when there are few points, like fert in 5-yr age groups), but don't sweat too much
# about endpoints as there are purpose-designed methods for particular 
# phenomena.
