# Function renaming coming soon.
# This page will contain deprecated function names.
# https://ropensci.org/technotes/2017/01/05/package-evolution/


# Ideas: 
# 1) snake case for method/ function families:
# 2) first part denotes family, second function.
# 3) so instead of LTabr() use lt_abridged()
#    lt_single(). For identity functions. mx2qx -> lt_identity_mx_to_qx
# These are more verbose names, but the longer ones are just internal,
# using segmented regular names like this helps with autocomplete in RStudio.

# 4) for the sake of autocomplete, carrier_farrag_smth(), should become smth_carrier_farrag()

# 5) like wise, Sprague -> graduate_sprague, Beers -> graduate_beers()
# 6) Other families: age_util_XXXX,
